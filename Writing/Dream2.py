This is another dream I had, this time with somone I actually know.  It was a friend's little sister.

dream = ("It's been a while since I have thought about this dream and it's"
        "nothing too special which is what makes is sadder when I think about it."
        "\nIn my dream I was at an amusement park.  \nI couldn't tell you for sure "
        "what park it was but part of me thinks it was disneyland(I think someone "
        "may have been wearing mickey mouse ears or maybe I even saw the mouse "
        "himself, but something made me think I was in there).\nI was resting"
        "near a bench when I felt a tap on my shoulder.\nI turned to see her "
        "standing there looking at me with the goofiest grin and an ice cream "
        "cone in each hand.\nShe extends the cone my way and I couldn't tell "
        "you what melted faster, the ice cream in the blistering summer sun,"
        "or my heart in the moment.")
